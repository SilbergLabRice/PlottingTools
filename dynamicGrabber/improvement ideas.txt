0. figure out how to push commits to https://github.com/SilbergLabRice/PlottingTools
- Seems to require admin access etc. Editing the readme directly on the website seemed to work so don't know what's wrong when pushing from local..

1. Make the file load directly from the .xls file output by Tecan/Infinite
- Figure out identifiers and differences

2. Get sample names and other metadata -- get the user to make a 96 well table in a 
different sheet?

3. Fix the plotting to show Std devs as a shadow rather than lines?> visually better

4. Need to vectorize a lot of the for loops -- ??
----------------------------
Rstudio version

Alternatively just copy the colours and run this is R -- since infrastructure is already setup
- implement datadivider to sub-sample data -- or a median filter
